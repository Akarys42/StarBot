# StarBot

**StarBot** is a highly configurable, general-purpose bot aiming to provide the essential functionalities needed to run your community while being an open-source alternative to larger bots.

Right now, while the bot is still in active development, no public instance is provided. If you would like to use our private instance, Luna ðŸ’«#6811, feel free to join [our server](https://discord.akarys.me) and shoot a message.

Our long term goal is for you to have everything you need to run your community by inviting the bot and typing a handful of commands. That said, we want to still make our bot configurable so it can truly fit your community.

# Self-hosting the Bot

As we do not provide managed instances *for the time being*, the only available option is for you to self-host. The only hard dependency of the bot is the [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.

For easier setup, you may wish to use our docker-compose setup. That will require you to create a `.env` file containing a `TOKEN` key mapping to your bot token.

We also have a container available at `ghcr.io/akarys42/starbot`. The image will also require a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable of the format `postgresql+asyncpg://$user:$password@$host:$port/$database`.

By default, the migrations aren't run. If you want the bot to automatically upgrade on startup, please set the environment variable `RUN_MIGRATION` to `1`. Alternatively, you can run `python -m alembic upgrade head` inside the container to migrate.

# Development Environment

Our docker-compose setup can be used for development. We recommend setting `DEBUG` to `1` and `TEST_GUILDS` to a comma-separated list of guilds you want the bot to instantaneously update in.

If you are interested in helping, please join [our server](https://discord.akarys.me) and introduce yourself in `#starbot`.

Our code is formatted using [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) and [ISort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort). Please make sure to run `poetry run task precommit` before committing to make sure your code will always pass linting.

Thank you for your interest in our project!
